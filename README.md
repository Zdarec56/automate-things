# automate-things
Various exercises on how to automate things
In this repository I will put some of my projects with Python related to automation. Some of them will be my own ideas, some of them will be based on the book "Automate the boring stuff with python" from Al Sweigart (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and also from the UDEMY course "Automate Everything with Python" (Ardit Sulce) https://www.udemy.com/course/automate-everything-with-python/. I strongly recommmend both sources.
